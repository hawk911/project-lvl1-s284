# Brain Games
Project 1 JavaScript 

Games are for the console.

## Information

### Games have: 

* brain-balance
* brain-calc
* brain-gcd
* brain-prime
* brain-progression

### Description:
* `brain-even` - A random number is inserted  by  a user. And the user needs to answer `yes`, if the number is even, or `no` - if odd.
* `brain-calc` - A random mathematical expression is shown to a user, for example 35 + 16, which you need to compute and write the correct answer.
* `brain-gcd` - Two random numbers are shown to a user, for example 25 50. The user must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.
* `brain-balance` - A balanced number is a number in which the smallest digit differs from the largest one by more than one. Examples of balanced numbers are `111, 233, 55, 001, 9999, 0001`.
* `brain-progression` - We show a user a series of numbers, forming an arithmetic progression, replacing any of the numbers with two points. The player has to determine this number.
* `brain-prime` - A random number is shown to a user. And the user needs to answer `yes`, if the number is prime, or `no` - if prime.
